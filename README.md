# Git - Github Reference

## Downloading git

You [can find git here](https://git-scm.com/downloads). To make your life easier, you may want to also [download a gui](https://git-scm.com/downloads/guis).

## Learning git

The ["official" website is a great resource.](https://git-scm.com/doc) However, if you really want to learn (and have 15 minutes of spare time), [play with this](https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1). It's free. :-)

Also, [great cheat-sheet](https://training.github.com/kit/downloads/github-git-cheat-sheet.pdf).

[And my
slides.](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1U8_-Spls_EDIJdoPSTKPX1bD86hGiQ3T1oKnhj4VM6E/edit?usp=sharing)
